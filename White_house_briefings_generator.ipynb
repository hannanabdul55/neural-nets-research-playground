            "We’re talking about more than just an energy deal because of what we’ve done in this country.  We have a whole different message here.  The people will recognize it.  You are going to start to see a lot and a lot of things happening over the next few weeks that, frankly, we never thought they could be in a position that they are.  And we certainly didn’t want this.\n",

            "But I think you know that the American people — I think they’re about ready to get into full speed ahead.\n",
            "Now, I have to tell you, with all of that being said, I want to ask every member of the White House team to come to the podium and I want the members of the Senate to come to the podium.  There are some — people, I know, on the other side of the aisle, I see people that want to give this thing away, and some just want to help.\n",
            "I really hope they come to it.  We need the help.  We need the help.  But this is about saving American jobs.  And it’ll take a lot of guts to do that.\n",
            "As the number of American deaths continues to mount — the fact that we have a nation that has lost 50, and it’s only counting the very active ones — it really shows you how big the problem is in America.  All of us have a part to play, and we all need to lead.\n",
            "But as we keep doing, we can’t let the virus, the coronavirus, and all of the things it does to people get out of hand.  So we have to have an effective partnership between the President, our team in the White House, and I- — and with the full powers of the federal government.\n",

            "THE PRESIDENT:  So, when Governor Cuomo was saying in the last time we were here — and I can assure you, Chris, governors across the country, including governor Chin, saying, �We’ve had 100 or more tests.  We’ve had no cases.  This is like — you know, we hope it’s going to go away.  But it’s going to come back because we had a great testing system.  We had more than enough testing to go — as many as we could.  And then we moved over to more — we moved over to —\n",

            "THE PRESIDENT:  — statewide exclusion?\n",
            "Q    No, no, not nationwide exclusion.  I mean, the states didn’t know the virus existed.  And the CDC — and I’m sure you know, Brennan also — actually EPA has been talking about the country being safe in the United States and the need for that to be maintained for many years now.\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\n",

            "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’ll tell you something: We do it by printing cases.  We actually — I have many cases where we’ve printed hundreds of containers.  And we’ve — we’re printing them in different colors.\n",
            "So, at — at their facilities, they’ve already completed them.  We’re working with them on that.  We’re — we’re working with them, probably more than any place on Earth.  But we’re strongly encouraged by what’s happening because when we started here, you didn’t have pasteurization, you didn’t have anything.  There’s — your grocery store was very different than it is today, and yet it was very — it was very easy to run.  And we’re making it even easier.  And we’re going to show them where the bottoms are.  We’re getting more and more and more and more.\n",
            "But we’re going to use and we’re going to have a lot of pods.  We’ll have boards with a lot of different numbers in them.  Boards can come in very easily.  So we’re further empowering the American public to bring the entire enterprise to life.  We want our grocery stores to be as successful as possible.  Good out.  Very good out.  And we’ll be — we’ll be working with them on that.\n",
            "Yes, ma’am.  Go ahead.\n",
            "CLARK:  Yes, sir.  Thank you, Mr. President.  The Secretary of the Treasury and the Chair of the National Governors Association just spoke and they embraced this wholeheartedly.  The governors agreed on the fundamentals: clear guidelines for the new federal guidelines for “adults only” breeding, providing guidance for those who would be pregnant, and making sure that all the governors were doing everything possible to make sure that those — that the governors were following the guidelines.\n",
            "Leaving aside concerns as to the safety of drinking, I want to talk a bit about one of our more unique and important components: New Mexico.  And I’ll begin with Vice President Pence.  Vice President Pence is here.  While all of you here are doing everything they can to keep America safe, we are doing everything we possibly can to make sure that New Mexico is safe, too.\n",
            "There’s been a lot of agency involvement in New Mexico, and I’ll — I’ll allow Vice President Pence the chance to speak, but it’s not the place of the Vice President to do so.\n",
            "So, New Mexico has the largest concentration of cattle futures in the country.  They’re getting very close to stability here.  We don’t know who will be the next governor.  But we know that they’re safe.  They’re stable.  And they’re making progress in locking up their nation for the next five years.\n",
            "And we feel confident, beginning with Secretary Pompeo, that we’re going to lock the nation down, while making sure that New Mexico gets the assistance that it needs.  So we’re working with the governor to make sure that the sovereignty and autonomy of New Mexico is taken care of.\n",
            "Daily Media has reported very accurately on the situation in New Mexico.  They have a strong economy, jobs — good ones — loyal workers.  And Governor Hickenlooper has been very patient and supportive of the many efforts to keep them safe, as Governor Kean mentioned.\n",
            "I want to walk through a few things.  First, I want to remind everyone who has been following the events of very recently here in Washington State: There is no need to panic.  We are working through the public health crisis in Washington State very hard, and we’ll get through this with understanding.\n",
            "But this — We just don’t want to see New York and New Jersey, where we’ve been in a very, very dangerous situation — Washington State — get to the point where they are battling coronavirus and losing people’s lives.  But we’re going to really make sure that New Mexico is safe.\n",

            "THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.  One of the things I’ve been emphasizing is that we have to stop illegal wildlife trade.  I’ve been saying that for quite some time.  And again, this is a very complex subject, and I’m going to try to yield to what’s happening in the press conference.  I’m not going to do this press conference.  I’m going to have a much more constructive relationship so that people can find out the truth.\n",
            "Q    Mr. President —\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  No, you don’t have a problem with that.  Let me — let me give you the — or let the media tell you the truth.  It’s illegal wildlife trade.\n",
            "THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It’s illegal wildlife trade.\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  It’s illegal trade, and you should be punished.\n",
            "THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mr. President, please.\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  So, if you find something illegal, let me tell you — let me let you know.  If you find something illegal, let me tell you why.  Just give me a reason.  Why?  One of my top generals told me that the United States was at fault.  I’m going to take a look, but it should be illegal trade and unfair trade.\n",
            "Who’s next?  Jeff Patterson, from Bridge Street, Texas.\n",
            "Q    Thank you, Mr. President, for that.  In the face of the challenge, there was a lot of back-of-the-napkin thinking going on with your decision to postpone the election of new governors.  Having gone through this with Pennsylvania —\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  Dave Grabelias —\n",
            "Q    — and Washington State, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Connecticut —\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  Thomas Curry, New Hampshire.\n",
            "Q    — Governor Nicole Malliotakis said she is under pressure from employers.  In the face of this pressure, what adjustments have you made?\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, it’s a very interesting topic.  I want to — I want to wait until the pandemic.  When you talk about pandemic, I want to go to the original sources first.  The original source — it should be called “the human-caused virus.”  Before it came in, it was just like anything.  It could have been stopped in its tracks.  And I was helping these governors by pushing them in the direction where the pandemic is going to be, maybe because people are paying a lot of money for their governor and their governor has been very good, as you know.\n",
            "But we’ve done a very good job.  In all fairness, Governor Beverly J. Tuite did very well, but she’s gotten hurt.  Governor Steve Gaynor went very quickly, for instance.  He’s going to Louisiana.  And he’s going to Connecticut, which was not in — not having the 16th Amendment.  And he’s going to Georgia, which frankly was a little bit short for what the hell a crisis is.\n",
            "But, look, the truth is, we had — and this has been good, whether you — whether you look at the graphs or not — the human-caused virus was not a factor in Georgia, Washington State, Rhode Island, New York, Montana, California, Florida.  Crucially, we had people speaking — people talking about the consequences of our foolish policies.\n",
            "And, as you know, governors are people, and they do make tough decisions.  I’ll tell you what: Since I began, it’s been seven of them.  And I did a lot of bad decisions in the last seven.\n",
            "Q    But do you — do you — do you think you did a good job trying to do this?\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  No, I think that’s — I think you’re talking about seven of them, but I did a lot of bad decisions.  I don’t think I did a very good job.  So you’re talking about seven governors.  I didn’t do a fair job.\n",
            "Q    Is this an example of the degree of weakness that you’re seeing in the use of the “16th Amendment?\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  No, I think you’re — no, I think you’ve got to look at — what’s happened is I have people that are talking about what’s wrong.  If you look — if you look\n",
            "====================\n",
            "Q  Mr. President, we are watching your comments today on C.A. —\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  By the way, yeah.\n",
            "Q  — and seeing some troubling things.  What do you say to Americans who are watching and who are concerned by what you are hearing?\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  I just hope they’re doing what they have to do.  I mean, to the people in the hospital, I — I just hope they’re doing what they have to do.  And, by the way, I’m a patient too, and I’ve had, you know, — from a significant percentage of the workers and the people who work for those companies, I’ve had coronavirus.  And, you know, for me, it’s a little bit different.  But I just hope they’re doing what they have to do.\n",
            "Please.\n",
            "Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Are you considering new states or new local authorities to manage healthcare, food distribution facilities or even schools to start?  Is there a distinction?\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ve been dealing with the state and local authorities for a while.  But we want to make sure that they have the manpower and the equipment to do it — whether it’s ventilators or whether it’s whatever it is, we want to help them.  And if they’re having difficulty in doing that, we’ms going to make sure they get the support that they need.\n",
            "John?\n",
            "Q    Mr. President, I would love to hear from you about the French systems.  If I could, Secretary Azar.  And you’ve just the other day heard a senior administration official say that there’s no risk for the American people from China’s coronavirus.  Secretary Azar, do you agree with that?  And —\n",
            "SECRETARY AZAR:  I think there’s risk and there’s no risk at all.  We’re an economic powerhouse and the risk to Americans is very low.\n",
            "Q    Do you agree with that assessment?  And —\n",
            "SECRETARY AZAR:  I don’t know what this senior administration official said or anything else.  Listen.\n",
            "Q    Yesterday, you told the media that new tests had been performed across the country.  But now in the past 24 hours, the experts say that, as of today May 11th, their findings are — in labs tests have been confirmed as showing no more than 20 cases.  So do you agree with that assessment or are you still shifting your focus to the coronavirus?\n",
            "SECRETARY AZAR:  No, I — look, we have hundreds of laboratories.  They’re doing tests in hospitals and in clinics to get results — wherever they are in the chain of transmission.  And I’m going to state the facts and the reality.  But you know, I really do believe, based on the first statistics from the United Nations, that we have a very small case.  And we’ve learned a lot about it.  We’ve learned a lot.\n",
            "Q    A question for you, sir —\n",
            "SECRETARY AZAR:  Right.\n",
            "Q    — Secretary Azar, if I could.  And one for our panel.  The Department of Health and Human Services today announced plans to shut down all medical facilities in more than 30 states, including protected like nursing homes.  Does HHS expect that this could happen?  And can you assure the American people of that?\n",
            "SECRETARY AZAR:  HHS expects that this will happen.  I mean, if you look at their weekly reports and you can see there’s not only a cas- — there’s not only a CDC decision on an emergency hospital meeting — and there’s a concern that there’s another motel in Ohio — but a couple of times that second hotel is in quarantine.\n",
            "So, you know, they’re moving to close those facilities off.  So we’ve been working very hard.  We’ve had—\n",
            "Q    Dr.  Fauci, you and others have been pushing it.  Well, even France — it says on their website that in one hospital there was 1,831 cases.  Is that correct or are they doing something else.\n",
            "THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, it is.  That’s what they’re working.  But it’s a small percentage of the cases.  It’s, you know, a very, you know, under 50 — under 50 percent, but that still looks like it’s very much over 1,000.  We’ve now closed 60.  We�\n",
            "====================\n",
            "Q  Mr. President, can I ask about the patchwork MREs program?  That has been created by the governors.  Will this create a situation where you have a MRE — people traveling from one state, they get infected in another state — I mean, you don’t know who to contact?  They get infected in one state, they get infected in another.  Do you have the confidence, Mr. President, that that MREs — being produced by FEMA will not be what we’re talking about?\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  I do, because the governors have been fantastic.  You look at their data.  Do you want to see what I’ve seen?  Do you want to see what FEMA has done in that?  No, they’ve been fantastic.  And, you know, they’re getting — I mean, again, it’s a — it’s a marvellous piece of equipment.  It’s a great piece of equipment.  We’re getting them the equipment.  We’re getting them — we’re getting them —\n",
            "Q    But — but you don’t know who to —\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  — talk to people on other airlines.  That’s all.\n",

            "THE PRESIDENT:  I knew nothing about that.  I know nothing about that.  Don’t be bullied by the media.\n",
            "Q    Do you have confidence in FEMA to lead this?  What do you believe in?  He is the point of —\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t have confidence in them.  I will say this: They’ve done an incredible job and the governors are saying the same thing, which has been great.\n",
            "John, go ahead.\n",
            "Q    Mr. President, as you know, the governor of New York, David Weldon, was — he’s a nurse —\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  He’s a great gentleman.  I had the very terrible status.\n",
            "Q    — and he has a complicated situation.  He’s a dentist and he’s left his practice.  And he’s taken a helicopter.  Is that related to his previous helicopter work?  Is that a factor?\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want to — it’s not a factor.  It’s — you know, David Weldon is a great professional.  And I hope he’s going to a place where he’s not going to — but he might have to — where he’ll have to use a helicopter to get out of a country.  So, I really don’t want to put a time limit.  I think you can do it.\n",
            "Great.  Go ahead, in the back.\n",
            "Q    Mr. President, as you know, at the state level, some governors appear to be paying little or no state income taxes at all.  What is your plan for that?  And what threshold do you expect that would be for tax increases?\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I would expect it to come — you know, it’s a — you know, the idea of paying the state income taxes, or not paying the state income taxes — I mean, that’s something that’s going to happen.  Maybe we should do it electronically.\n",
            "Q    Is that something you’re thinking of?\n",
            "THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it might be.  They look like they are not getting their money.  It’s a — it’s a mystery to me.  And it’s something that they seem to be not getting — but we’ll have answers.  But I think these people have a fiduciary relationship with the taxpayers of their states.  They can pick up the tab for things that they’ve been — I mean, they have some very large places in one — Illinois, Michigan, Louisiana, and New York — and they pick up the tab.  But they don’t do that.\n",
            "And, God, what a day it is for America.  People that don’t deserve it — and I don’t believe we should treat them like it’s a health issue, it’s a safety issue, but it’s a state issue.  It’s a very different situation than you find in Europe; a very different situation than what we found in Europe — both from the standpoint of the numbers that we’re having and the numbers that we’re getting.  And I think when we get it, it’ll be like another music\n",
